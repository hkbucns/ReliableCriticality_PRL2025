This program encompasses code for reliable avalanche analysis (https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.028401) and will subsequently incorporate self-organized criticality mechanisms for investigating representational drift.

For the reliable avalanche project, we provide the following code modules:
Numerical simulation of spiking networks for scale-free avalanche dynamics (Result_scale_free_avalanche.py)
Analysis of reliable avalanche patterns for neural representation (Result_reliableavalanche.py)

The figures generated by above code is incluced in the example_figure.
